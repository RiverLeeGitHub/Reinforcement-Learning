## Black-box Optimization

Black-box optimization (BBO) algorithms are generic optimization algorithms. They are called black-box because they treat the objective funcition f as a black-box. The algorithms don't look inside of the function to leverage knowledge about its structure in order to speed up the optimization process. For RL, this means that BBO algorithms will not leverage the knowledge that the environment can be modeled as an MDP.
